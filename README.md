Your task is to use the bloom of flowers to summon bees and help them pollinate other flowers. Bees are an important Nexus to this garden.

They create a special bond with the flowers by gathering nectar. You need to subtly direct the movement of the bees, allowing them to pass sweet nectar between flowers.

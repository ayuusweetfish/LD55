# Hints and Solutions to _Nectar Nexus_

The solution to each puzzle will be given as a string of digits:
- Digit 0 denotes an empty step (without triggering blossoms);
- Digit 1-9 denote the triggering of a blossom of that respective number — refer to the screenshots attached.

This string can be typed directly into the game screen to progress through each step. For clarity, digits are displayed in groups of four.


The rule for turning, in case you need it:

  The vertical pair needs a direct, straight route through them (because 4 blossoms will be required otherwise).
  Which bee is the one to do this? Quickly eliminating some of the obscure, infeasible options, we are left with the lower bee doing a backward turn.
  When should this happen? A lockstep can be carefully crafted so that the upper bee ends up at the correct row.

  The rebounding obstacle turns useful afterwards.
